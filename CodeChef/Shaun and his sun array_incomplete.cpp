Shaun And His Subarrays         COCA2001


Shaun is very much interested in Subarrays. Shaun wants to count the number of subarrays in his chosen array with sum being a multiple of 109. Since, Shaun is interested in huge numbers.He chose his array such that it contains only 108 and 9*108 as its elements.

Help shaun to count the number of required subarrays.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains one integer N,size of array A.
Second line of each testcase contains N space separated array elements
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line number of subarrays with sum being multiple of 109.

Constraints
1=T=10
1=N=105
A[i]=108 , 9*108
Sample Input:
   2
   3
   100000000 900000000 100000000
   1
